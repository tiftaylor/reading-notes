## Growth Mindset
***In my own words***: Success and achievement can be obtained by any person who believes that their foundational attributes and abilities can be developed with persistence and hard work.

Three reminders for how to keep a Growth Mindset:
>1.  When stuck, instead of making a negative comment, ask a question.
>2.  Take moments to evaluate the level of effort I'm committing to something and acknowledge what that actual level is with recognition if satisfactory or with encouragement if fit needs improvement.
>3.  Remember that feedback is not a personal attack, remember that you are there to learn from others. Two heads are better than one!
