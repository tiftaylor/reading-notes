### What makes a computer, a computer?

- A machine designed to manipulate information
- Take input / the stuff you’re doing (talking, touching screen, etc)
- Store & Process info / takes input from memory stores it and processes it
- Output the results / show games, text, photos, etc or even signals to control robots

### Circuits and Logic

- Every Input and Output are represented by 1’s and 0’s
- The computer modifies the input signals with Circuits
- Circuits modify and process binary information via flipping it to the opposite
- Circuits use Boolean logic to create its output value
- Circuits have adders that add bits of info to create larger numbers
- Smaller computers/circuits are faster because it’s less distance for electricity to travel

### Hardware and Software

- Hardware: wires, chips, speakers, etc.
- Software: code, computer programs (apps, games, web pages)
- *C*entral *P*rocessing *U*nit: master chip to control all other parts of the computer. Has circuits for math and logic, other circuits for send/receive info
- CPU has different commands to tell it which processor to use (like Add or Store) / talks with the Memory to figure this out
- Binary is the most basic form of Software / modern sw is converted to binary
- Operating System is master program manages _how_ software uses the hardware
- OS can help the memory and CPU know what to do
