## General Notes from the MDN Sending Data page

When a user *submits* a form - where does the data go? How do we handle the data when it gets to where it's going? 

- A client (like browser) sends a request to a server using the HTTP protocol, the server answers with the same protocol
- HTML `form` is user-friendly way to configure HTTP request to *send data* to a server
- The `<form>` element defines **how** the data is sent w/its `action` and `method` attributes

`action` attribute defines **where** data is sent via a: 
  - *relative URL* `<form action="/somewhere_else">`
  - *absolute URL* `<form action="https://example.com>`

> Note: If your form is hosted on HTTPS but you specifiy data to be sent to HTTP (insecure) you will get a security warning as a user because data will not be encrypted.

- The server responds by handling data and loading the URL, often causing a page reload if pointed to the same page. 

`method` attribute defines **how** data is sent
- HTML form data is transmitted most commonly as `GET` or `POST` method

  >Remember: HTTP request consists of 2 things: **header** that contains set of global metadata about browser capabilities and **body** with necessary info for the server to process

- `GET` basically asks the server to send back a specific resource
- You'll see that resource appear in the address bar when you submit the form: 
  - `www.foo.com/?say=Hi&to=Mom` appears with this code in the html: 
  - <image src="../images/read13-1.png" style="width: 400px">
  - Data in the URL is series of key/value pairs tied with `&`
- `POST` basically says "Hey server, look at this data and send me back an appropriate result" and the data is appended to the **body** of the HTTP request.
- Note: The POST method does NOT append data in the URL. A `POST` HTTP request looks like this: 
  - <image src="../images/read13-2.png" style="width: 300px">
  - `Content-Length` header indicates size of body
  - `Content-Type` header is type of resrouce sent to server
- HTTP requests are never dispalyed to the user, if you want to see them use Chrome Dev tools in the Network section

> REMEMBER | Only thing the users sees is the URL called (when using GET) and with POST the user sees nothing. Ex: To send a *password* NEVER use GET because you don't want this to show up in the URL

## On the Server Side | When it recieves Data
- It takes a string and parses to get the key/value pair data
- It is accessed depending on the **development platform** and **framework** you use 
- While there are many server-side technologies for form handling, it is more common to use a **high-quality framework** such as: 
  - Django for Python
  - Express for Node.js
  - Laravel for PHP
  - Ruby on Rails for Ruby
- Frameworks make it easier than trying to do this from scratch

## A note about sending Files
- There are 3 special requirements to consider when sending files
  - Set `method` to `POST` so it's not in the URL
  - Set the value of `enctype` to `multipart/form-data`
  - Include one or more `<input type="file">` controls to allow users to select the file(s) that will be uploaded
  > Tip: set size limit to prevent abuse

## A note about Security 
- Never trust your users or yourself!
- Attacks most commonly happen in the part that dictates **how** the server handles data
- **All data** must be checked and santizied!! 
  - Escape dangerous characters like char sequences that look like executable code liks JS or SQL
  - Limit incoming amount of data to what's necessary
  - Sandbox uploaded files (store them in a different server and allow access via a subdomain)
