#### Pair Programming
- Two roles: **Driver** and the **Navigator**.   
  - Driver is the one typing, handling the mechanics (text editor, switching files, version control and code writing).   
  - Navigator uses words to guide driver but doesn't touch the computer / thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algo could be converted to code, scans for typos and bugs (they can use their own computer to google solutions and documentation)
- Six reasons to Pair Program are: Greater efficiency / Engaged collaboration / Learning from fellow students / Social skills / Job Interview readiness / Work environment readiness
