### CSS
- creates style rules for everything in the body tag
- you assign properties to html elements, ids, or classes
- each css declaration needs to contain the property and its value
- the css sheet is linked in the html ```<head>``` tag using the `<link>` html element
- css rules have specificity hierarchy and inheritance

### Color
- css can use rgb values, hex codes, color names
- primarily you use color for backgrounds and text
- be sure to think about contrast and opacity
- consider the hsl and hsla properties (hue, saturation, lightness)
