- A function is a place for you to group several statements together to perform a specific task and can be reused
- Always use the keyword `function` with a function name like “doMath”
- Functions may or may not take in information, if they do, it is called a parameter
- Call functions with (), Ex: doMath() / if your function used parameters you would put those values in the () like this: doMath(1,3)
- Use `return` to get a single value from the function (usually paired with a var name) / or the `return` can be assigned to an array to get more than one value as a result
