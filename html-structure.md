Textbook: _Jon Duckett: HTML & CSS_

### Process & Design
- Understand **_who_** your website is for (individuals vs. companies)
- Understand **_why_** you want people on your website
- Understand **_what_** the visitors need to acheive the goal of the website
- Understand **_how_** often your content needs to be updated and how often people will visit the site
- Create a **_site map_** to understand the overall structure of your various pages/content
- Design a **_wireframe_** showing how each page layout will look (logo, buttons, text box, etc)
- Get your message across by thinking about these categories: 
   - Content
   - Priortizing (disction on the page)
   - Organizing (content chunks)
   - Visual Heirarchy (size, color, style)
   - Grouping (use of borders, white space, etc)
   - Similarity (like all clickable links are same color)


### Structure
- This refers to your overall flow/structure of your page using elements made up of tags
- Similiar to how you'd structure a classic document in MS Word
- The main required elements for every page are: ```<html>```, ```<head>```, ```<body>```
- The ```body``` is where the content goes that the user will see, and metadata is typed in the ```head```
- Most elements will have opening ```<p>``` and closing ```</p>``` tags *(though some will be standalone)*
- Tags ```<p>``` can have Attribute names & values in the opening tag


### HTML5 Layout
- New elements added for use such as: ```<nav>```, ```<header>```, ```<footer>```, ```<aside>```, etc.
- You can now place an anchor tag around a block level element to make the entire block clickable


### Extra Markup
- Comment in your code to help others understand the purpose of a section using ```<!-- -->```
- Use Global Attributes like ```class``` and ```id``` to be able to refer to specific elements in other code files (like css and javascript)
- Use the ```<meta>``` tag in your **_head_** like a description, key words, robots, author, etc. 
- If you want to use an html character like ‘<’ you can use escape characters associated with it (google it for the character you’re trying to escape out into your presentation)
