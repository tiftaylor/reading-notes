# [Read:03 \| Git Intro](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)

### Git \| The foundation of version control
- git is a version control system that can be utilized as local, central or distributed (think collaboration)
- it provides snapshots of files at the various points in time of commit actions
- git has 3 stages: committed, modified and staged that are utilized as gatekeepers


### Git vs. GitHub
- git is the actual version control technology / GitHub is storage in the browser that utilizes git
- git is used directly via the terminal with git commands (though you can download a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface like "GitHub Desktop" for a more user friendly approach)


### Git on your Local Computer
- You can import/create or clone GitHub repositories to get a project going (see commands link below)
- You'll use [git commands](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) in your Terminal to make changes to the files in your repo
- All changes live on your local computer until you Add / Commit / Push to GitHub from your local computer
- Note: ```git push``` command has ```origin``` that you'll use to attach the branch to like ```master```


### Tips!
- try NOT to make changes to files on GitHub \| use an IDE (like **VSCode**) to edit files and then push them to GitHub
- ```git status``` is a super helpful command!
