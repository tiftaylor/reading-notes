# Read:08 \| Operators & Loops in JS
Textbook: _Jon Duckett: HTML & CSS_

### Comparison & Logical Operators 
- Comparison operator `==` and `===` differ only in that `===` won’t auto-convert the data type and is therefore the more secure one to use
- With the Comparison not equal to something, it’s better to use !== to preserve the data type
- Logical operators allow you to compare more than one Comparison operator
- Logical examples are: && (and), II (or), ! (not)
- You can google logic operator tables for the truth/false equations of expected results [Here’s an example article](https://dev.to/banesag/javascript-logical-operators-and-boolean-values-1l07)

### For Loop & While Loop
- Loops check a condition x number of times (if **while** then it loops until it's true, if **for** then checks the number of times you’ve set in the condition)
- Special case: **do...while** loop will run at least once even if false
- In *for loops* initialize (var i = 0;), set the condition (i < 10;) and update on next iteration (i++)
