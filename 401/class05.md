Some ideas for how you might want to teach:

    Use an analogy
    Explain a detail in depth
    Use WHY, WHAT, HOW structure
    Tutorial / walk through an example
    Write a quiz
    Create a vocabulary/definition list
    Write a cheat sheet
    Create a diagram / visualization / cartoon of a topic
    Anthropomorphize the concepts, and write a conversation between them
    Build a map of the information
    Construct a fill-in-the-blank worksheet for the topic
