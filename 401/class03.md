  - asdf

What is one downside of Test Driven Development
  - asd

**Document the following Vocabulary Terms**  
Term | Defition  
--|--  
functional programming | A style of programming that strictly uses math as its equation style and uses data that doesn't change (stateless?) and uses a declarative model and focuses on "what" you are doing and renders no side effects. 
pure function | there is no variation for it's variable which remains static. No input aspects from a device.
higher-order function | Kind of like a "father" function, it takes one or more functions as an argument and also returns a function (for my father analogy: is a human, takes another human and returns a new human)
immutable state | data that doesn't change
object | Basically, some data. It lives in `{}` in JS and can consist of anything, like variables, key/value pairs, functions, data structures, etc.
object-oriented programming (OOP) | Can use data that changes (mutable) and is considered an imperative model and focuses on "how" you are doing something. The methods used can cause side effects (unlike functional programming) and uses the "loop" concept for iteration. 
class | It's like a template for creating objects that provides inital states and behavior.
prototype | an objects private property that is a link to another object
super | Super keyword is used when referring to a class parent object
inheritance | When "something" is passed down to it's children code blocks/functions that impacts them / they are using from it's parent even though it isn't implicitly written in their block.
constructor | Similar to `class`, a template to use for making instances of an object.
instance | One specific creation of an object that was built from calling a `new` constructor and providing it paramaters
context | Simply put, the place within the scope of code of where you're currently working
this | a keyword in JS that is based on context of it's scope
Test Driven Development (TDD) | "Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
Jest | "Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!" [jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io/)
Continuous Integration (CI) | "a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests." [Codeship](https://codeship.com/continuous-integration-essentials#:~:text=Continuous%20Integration%20(CI)%20is%20a,automated%20build%20and%20automated%20tests.)
unit test | "typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing#:~:text=Unit%20tests%20are%20typically%20automated,an%20individual%20function%20or%20procedure.)
