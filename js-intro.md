Textbook: _Jon Duckett: HTML & CSS_

### JavaScript Tidbits
- HTML = content, CSS = presentation, JavaScript = behavior
- JS is plain text like HTML and CSS so no special tools needed to write the script
- Connect the JS script via a `<script>` tag in the HTML body / it matters where you place this
- _Calling a method_ is using an object, a dot and the method() / Ex: `document.write(‘hello’);`
- Methods often have parameters (the values written in the parenthesis(‘hello’))
- To use a quote in a string you can use the escape key `/`

### JS Lingo
- *Statements*: are instructions and each one starts a new line; can be organized in code blocks and usually end with `;`
- *Comments*: Single line comments explaining the code is written with `//` before the text (multi-line uses `/* */`)
- *Variables*: declare them like this `var thing;`, assign them using = Ex: `thing = 3;`
- Names can’t start with a number, cannot use - or . and use camelCase
- *Data Types*: Numeric data (0.75), String data (“Hello”), Boolean Data (true/false)
